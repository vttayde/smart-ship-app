# 🛠️ Development Workflow Guide

## 🎯 Optimized Development Process

### 📋 Daily Development Workflow

#### 1. **Feature Development**

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make multiple commits (no deployments triggered)
git add .
git commit -m "Add new component"
git commit -m "Update styles"
git commit -m "Fix tests"

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create Pull Request (triggers preview deployment only)
gh pr create --title "Add new feature" --body "Description"

# After review, merge PR (triggers 1 production deployment)
gh pr merge --squash
```

#### 2. **Documentation Updates**

```bash
# Use [skip-deploy] for docs-only changes
git commit -m "Update README with deployment info [skip-deploy]"
git push origin main  # No deployment triggered!
```

#### 3. **Hot Fixes**

```bash
# Urgent production fixes (will deploy immediately)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
# Make fix
git commit -m "HOTFIX: Critical bug fix"
git push origin main  # Deploys immediately
```

#### 4. **Batch Development**

```bash
# Collect multiple changes
git add file1.ts
git commit -m "Add feature A"

git add file2.ts
git commit -m "Add feature B"

git add file3.ts
git commit -m "Update documentation"

# Squash into single deployment
git rebase -i HEAD~3
# Choose "squash" for last 2 commits
# Push once = 1 deployment instead of 3
```

## 🚦 Deployment Control Keywords

### Skip Deployment

```bash
git commit -m "Update documentation [skip-deploy]"
git commit -m "Fix typos and formatting [skip-deploy]"
git commit -m "Add code comments [skip-deploy]"
```

### Force Deployment (Future Enhancement)

```bash
git commit -m "Minor UI update [force-deploy]"
```

## 📊 Deployment Budget Management

### Free Tier Limits (Vercel Hobby)

- **100 deployments/day**
- **Resets at midnight UTC**
- **Preview deployments count toward limit**

### Smart Usage Strategy

- **Morning:** Plan day's changes
- **Afternoon:** Batch development work
- **Evening:** Single merge/deployment
- **Documentation:** Use `[skip-deploy]`

### Daily Deployment Target

```
🎯 Target: <20 deployments/day
📊 Breakdown:
  - Production: 2-3 deployments
  - Staging: 5-8 deployments
  - Preview: 10-15 deployments
  - Emergency: 2-3 buffer
```

## 🔧 Tools & Commands

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Check deployment status
gh run list --limit 5

# Manual deployment (if needed)
gh workflow run deploy.yml

# Cancel running deployment
gh run cancel <run-id>

# View deployment logs
gh run view <run-id>
```

### Git Aliases (Add to ~/.gitconfig)

```bash
[alias]
    # Quick commit with skip-deploy
    docs = "!f() { git add . && git commit -m \"$1 [skip-deploy]\"; }; f"

    # Feature branch creation
    feature = "!f() { git checkout -b feature/$1; }; f"

    # Squash last N commits
    squash = "!f() { git rebase -i HEAD~$1; }; f"
```

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Quick doc update
git docs "Update API documentation"

# Create feature branch
git feature "user-dashboard"

# Squash last 3 commits
git squash 3
```

## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics

### Weekly Review Checklist

- [ ] Total deployments this week
- [ ] Successful vs failed deployments
- [ ] Average deployment time
- [ ] Documentation vs feature deployment ratio

### Optimization Metrics

```
✅ Good Week:
  - <50 total deployments
  - >90% success rate
  - <5 emergency fixes
  - Documentation changes use [skip-deploy]

⚠️ Review Needed:
  - >80 deployments
  - <85% success rate
  - >10 emergency fixes
  - Multiple rapid-fire commits
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **PR-only production deployments**
2. **Automated deployment queuing**
3. **Smart preview deployment limits**
4. **Deployment cost tracking**
5. **Performance-based deployment triggers**

This workflow should reduce your daily deployments by 70-80% while maintaining development velocity! 🎯
